Nike changed their statergy of RSVP marketing to disuade bots but the new one isnt Bot proof.

This bot passes the turing test.

I have collected a recent sample of nike images released all across US.
This is able to give a 10/16 correct strike.
Which is good enough.
(Im using the open source tesseract OCR using sone other OCR with pre image enhancement may increase it further.)

To run ->

python doall.py

The ROI is marked by Red but the actuall area gets a green strike.
